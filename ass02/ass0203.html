<h3><a id="Intro">Introduction</a></h3>
<p align="justify">Applications are invited for the above M.Sc. course from graduates who are interested in postgraduate
    training in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology </p>
<p align="justify">The proposed Postgraduate Programme in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology is committed to strengthen
    and update theoretical and practical skills in graduates of biological sciences and related sciences and to train
    young scientists in different fields of molecular biology research. The curriculum of the course has been designed
    incorporating both pure and applied sciences envisaging a well-balanced course. The M.Sc. course is comprised of two
    alternative programmes. One programme (Programme I) is a taught course that consists of formal course modules and
    supervised practical exercises. The other programme is a M. Sc. with a research component (Programme II). The
    Programme II thus includes the entire Programme I activities and, in addition, autonomous research leading to a M.
    Sc. thesis. The aim of the thesis is to provide in depth training in specialized field of interest within the main
    subject area of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology.</p>

<h3><a id="obj">Objectives</a> </h3>

<p align="justify">The objectives of the M. Sc. course are to train graduates to be able to gather and to disseminate
    knowledge and experience in the field of molecular biology and biotechnology. In addition, it is intended to train
    graduates to be able to conduct independent research, particularly by Programme II. Also it offers opportunities for
    successful development of specific career and professional objectives. </p>


<h3><a id="elgb">Eligibility</a> </h3>
B.Sc. (Special) Degree in Botany, Zoology, Chemistry, Fisheries Biology or Agriculture from a recognized University/
institution <br />
or <br />
B.Sc. (General) Degree in Biological Sciences, M.B.B.S., B.D.S. <br />
and B.V.S. from a recognized University/ institution <br />
or <br />
any other equivalent qualification acceptable to the Board of Study. <br />
<br />

<h3><a id="strct">Course structure</a></h3>
There are two types of M.Sc. Degrees offered: M.Sc. by coursework (three semesters) and M.Sc. by coursework and research
(four semesters). M.Sc. by coursework is a degree that requires the student to attend lectures and practicals and
assignments etc. Assessment is by written examination and assignments. A candidate who registers for the fourth semester
is expected to produce a thesis, developed through research of a topic with direct relevance to molecular biology and
biotechnology that has been approved by an advisor. A student who wishes to do a thesis must complete the course work
successfully and must secure a source of funds in order to carry out the research. Each semester is 15 weeks long.
Lectures and practicals will be held on Saturdays and Sundays. Usually, for lectures, 15-hrs work is considered as one
credit.
<p>This norm may vary by +-5 lecture hours, as decided by the respective lecturers<br />
</p>


<h3><a id="applc">Application procedure</a></h3>
Every application for enrolment must be made in duplicate on the prescribed forms obtained from the course coordinator
on payment of a prescribed fee. The acceptance of the application will be determined on the basis of the particulars
disclosed based on academic requirements.
(1). It is the responsibility of the applicant to send copies of transcripts directly to the course coordinator.
(2). Two letters of recommendation, at least one of which should be from an academic referee shall be sent to the course
coordinator under confidential cover.
(3). Originals of all required certificates should be produced before admission.

Duly completed applications should be forwarded to the course coordinator. Applications that are incomplete or carrying
false information will be rejected. The applicants will be informed of their acceptance/ non-acceptance in due course.

Further information and application forms can be obtained by contacting the Coordinator by mail, email or phone.

<h3><a id="req">Requirements for the M.Sc. Degree</a></h3>
<p>The course consists of three divisions as follows:
    1. Course modules
    2. Assignments and seminars
    3. Research project (only for programme II)
    The relevant examinations shall be held at the end of each semester or at the end of each module. Total number of
    credits that a student must earn is 30.</p>
